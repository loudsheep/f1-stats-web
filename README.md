# 🏎️ F1 Stats Web

A passion project turned collaborative effort — this website is built by F1 enthusiasts who also happen to be developers.

## 📖 About

This project started as a side hobby to combine my love for Formula 1 with web development. As a fullstack developer, I began building this in my spare time — now a couple of friends have joined in, contributing their own skills and excitement for F1.

We're building this because we love the sport and enjoy coding things we want to use ourselves.

## 💻 Tech Stack

- **Next.js** (App Router)
- **TypeScript**
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **Python Django** (as backend)

## 🤝 Contributions

This is a passion-driven project, but we're open to feedback and ideas. If you're an F1 fan and developer, feel free to explore, suggest features, or fork the repo.
